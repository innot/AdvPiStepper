History
=======

AdvPiStepper was started for a Raspberry Pi project where I needed to move a stepper motor
for 400 +/- a few steps. I wanted acceleration and deceleration ramps because
an early Arduino based prototype had them. As I could not find any suitable RPi library
I started this programm, which quickly spiraled out of control and became this
multipurpose stepper motor controller.

V0.9 Work in Progress - Not officially released
