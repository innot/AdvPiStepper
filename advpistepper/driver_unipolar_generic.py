"""
Driver for generic Unipolar Stepper Motors.

Baseclass for all `unipolar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor#Unipolar_motors>`__
motor drivers, but can also be used by itself.
It generates the GPIO sequences for eiter FULLSTEP mode, where two coils
are powered for each step, or HALFSTEP mode, wher either one or two coils
are powered at each step.

Unless overridden by a subclass or by the user this driver uses the following
default parameters:

- MAX_SPEED: 800 steps/second (120rpm)
- MAX_TORQUE_SPEED: 100 steps/second
- ACCELERATION_RATE: 2000 steps / second^2
- DECELERATION_RATE: 3000 steps / second^2
- FULL_STEPS_PER_REV: 200 Full steps per revolution (1.8Â° per step)
- MICROSTEP_OPTIONS: FULLSTEP or HALFSTEP.
- MICROSTEP_DEFAULT: FULLSTEP

Besides the (optional) parameters this driver needs the the 4 GPIO pins connected to
the A+, A-, B+ and B- coils (called a1, a2, b1 and b2 by the driver)

.. note::
    Except for very low power stepper motors the motor wires should not be connected
    to the Raspberry directly. To provide sufficient power to the motor a driver like
    the `ULN2003A <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ULN2003A>`__ should be used.
