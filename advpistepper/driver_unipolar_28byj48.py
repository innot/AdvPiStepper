Driver for the popular 28BYJ-48 stepper motor.

The 28BYJ-48 is a small, 5V or 12V stepper motor with an integrated reduction gear which
results in 2048 full steps per revolution of the output shaft. Due to the high
reduction gear (64:1), this stepper motor is rather slow.
Without any hacks (e.g. higher voltage; bipolar mods) and without much load
the 28BYJ-48 should be able to do about 15 rpm or about 500 steps per second.

The 28BYJ-48 is a unipolar motor and is often sold together with a small driver board
based on the ULN2003 Darlington array for less than 3â‚¬.

This driver just defines the following parameters for this motor, guessed from this
`datasheet <https://www.digikey.de/de/datasheets/mikroelektronika/mikroelektronika-step-motor-5v-28byj48-datasheet>`__
with the help of the `stepper motor glossary <https://www.anaheimautomation.com/support/stepper_motor_glossary.htm>`__

There are numerous variants of the 28BYJ-48 on the market with slightly different parameters, so
these parameters are on the conservative side. Each can be overriden by providing an optional
dictionary with alternative values to the constructor.

- MAX_SPEED: 650 steps/second (~10 rpm)
- MAX_TORQUE_SPEED: 120 steps/second
- ACCELERATION_RATE: 2000 steps / second^2
- DECELERATION_RATE: 4000 steps / second^2
- FULL_STEPS_PER_REV: 2048 Full steps per revolution
- MICROSTEP_OPTIONS: FULLSTEP or HALFSTEP.
- MICROSTEP_DEFAULT: HALFSTEP

Halfstep is the recommended rate for the 28BYJ-48

Besides the motor characteristics this driver uses colors for the 4 control wires which seem
to be standard for all 28BYJ-48 variants.

- pink / orange for A+ and A-
- yellow / blue for B+ and B-

.. note::
    The motor wires should not be connected to the Raspberry directly. To provide sufficient
    power to the motor a driver like the `ULN2003A <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ULN20030>`__
    should be used.
